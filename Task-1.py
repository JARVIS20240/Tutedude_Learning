# step-1 Takes two Numbers from user: 
number_1=int(input("Enter a 1st Number: "))
number_2=int(input("Enter a 2nd Number: "))

# Some Mathematical Operation on Thoose two numbers:
addition= number_1 + number_2
subtraction= number_1 - number_2
multiplication= number_1 * number_2
division= number_1 / number_2

#For a Output:
print("Addition: ",addition)
print("Substraction: ",subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ",multiplication)
print("Division: ",division)
